# 📂 TECHIN Projects

This folder contains projects, tasks, and exercises from my **TECHIN coding lessons**.  
It’s where I practice the fundamentals of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** while learning at school.  

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice coding through TECHIN coursework.  
- Strengthen my frontend development skills step by step.  
- Document my progress as I grow from beginner to advanced.  

## 🧰 What's Inside
Each subfolder in `/TECHIN/` usually includes:  
- 🤖 HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- ⚡ JavaScrip
- 📝 Notes or instructions related to the lesson  

## 🚀 Notes
These are **learning projects**, not everything will be perfect yet.  
I’ll improve my code as I learn more at TECHIN and through personal practice.
